# FPGA-Image-Processing

- FPGA Board: Xilinx Nexys 4 Artix-7
- IDE: Vivado 2022.2
- Language: Verilog

## Description

This project is a simple image processing system that can perform the following operations on a 24-bit RGB image:

- Convert to grayscale
- Invert colors
- Brightness adjustment
- Contrast adjustment
- Gamma correction
- Color filterization

The image processing system is implemented on an FPGA board. The image is stored in the FPGA's block RAM and the processed image is displayed on a VGA monitor.
